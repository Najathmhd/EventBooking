# EventBooking Metropolitan System

The EventBooking system focuses on core event management and ticket reservation functionalities suitable for a metropolitan cultural council. The system allows guests and registered members to browse upcoming events displayed with suitable images and essential event information, enhancing visual appeal and user experience. 
Users can search and filter events based on categories, dates, and venues for easier discovery. 

Advanced features such as online payment processing, QR code ticketing, and automated email notifications were intentionally excluded to maintain system simplicity and align with the academic scope of the coursework. The implemented features ensure secure authentication, role-based access control, structured event management, booking validation, and meaningful user interaction through reviews and inquiries.
